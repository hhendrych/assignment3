Info: This project was created in January, 2024 as an Assignment project for Practical Computing for Biologists course. Nonetheless, this is only the beginning of the Research Project I.
Description: This script aims to compare isotopic profiles (d13C and d15N) gathered from different locations, create scattered plots for both individual and grouped locations. In addition, it calculates mean values for d13C and d15N in samples for both all locations and grouped locations. Standart deviation is included. Values of d13C and d15N are tested for normal distribution. The script also performs One-way ANOVA and Randomization Test.
Files included: The folder includes input files "isotopes.tsv", "locations.tsv", output files "merged_df.tsv" and "output_means", "scatter_all_locations" and "scatter_grouped_locations" figs,
the script itself "Assignment_3_jhendrych_s5687217" and this very "README.txt" file.
